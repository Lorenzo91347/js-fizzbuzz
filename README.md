# Counter

this exercise makes a counter from 1 to 100.
As a special caveat,when the counter reaches a number
that can be divided by 3,5 or both,instead of a 
number it will log Buzz,Fizz and BuzzFizz respectively.

Steps:
 1. declare 2 variables,one for the start and the end of the counter.
 2. using "for",write the functions to allow it to count till 100.
 3. Afterwards,write conditionals for a trigger at the module calculus of 3,5 and 15
    to trigger the log of the respective words.
